# WebPageTest REST API
The WebPageTest [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API provides a way for you to programatically interact with WebPageTest and all of its functionality, enabling you to integrate WebPageTest data into your existing processes and workflows in the way that best suits your needs.

[![runinpostman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/307bb2053694fe3d786c?action=collection%2Fimport)

::: note
The [official Node.js WebPageTest API wrapper](https://github.com/marcelduran/webpagetest-api)—built by Marcel Duran—provides a convenient NodeJS interface for the API and also exposes handy a <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr>.

There's also an [ever-growing repository of common recipes for the the API](https://github.com/WebPageTest/WebPageTest-API-Recipes), using the Node.js wrapper to help you get started.
:::

## Authentication
The WebPageTest API uses API keys to authenticate all tests submitted to the public WebPageTest testing agents.

::: note
API keys may or may not be required for requests made to any [private instances](/private-instances/) you maintain on your own. Check with the administrator of your private instance to verify.
:::

You can pass your API key along with tests requests by using the `k` parameter.

```text
https://www.webpagetest.org/runtest.php?url={your_domain}&k={your_api_key}
```

::: warning
Your API keys are directly tied to your account, so be sure to keep them secure. Avoid sharing them in any public area, such as GitHub or client-side code.
:::
## Status Codes
The WebPageTest API uses HTTP response codes in the `statusCode` property of return objects to indicate whether an API request was sucessful or failed. Codes in the `1xx` range indicate that the requested test is not yet ready. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate there was an error with the requested test. A status code of `200` indicates a successful test run.

| Status Code | Description                    |
|-------------|:-------------------------------|
| 100         | Test started                   |
| 101         | Test is in the queue           |
| 102         | The test server is unreachable |
| 200         | The test is complete           |
| 400         | A test with the `testId` passed was not found |
| 401         | The `testId` is valid, but no test was found in the work queue |
| 402         | The test with the `testId` passed was cancelled |

## Running a Test
To submit a test to the WebPageTest agents, you submit either a POST or GET request to the https://www.webpagetest.org/runtest.php endpoint, along with your API key, the URL you want to test and any optional parameters to configure your how the test is run and what data it will return when completed.

### Response Format
By default, after a successful request to the `/runtest.php` endpoint, you will be redirected to the results page.

You can optionally set the response format using the `f` parameter to return either an XML response (`f=xml`) or JSON response (`f=json`).

```text
//this will result in a redirect
https://www.webpagetest.org/runtest.php?url={your_domain}&k={your_api_key}

//this will return an XML response
https://www.webpagetest.org/runtest.php?url={your_domain}&k={your_api_key}&f=xml

//this will return a JSON response
https://www.webpagetest.org/runtest.php?url={your_domain}&k={your_api_key}&f=json
```

Here's an example response when the format parameter is provided to the endpoint:

Set to 1 to run [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/) to identify what technologies are used on a page. If set to 0, WebPageTest will skip the Wappalyzer detection phase (resulting in faster test results).
**Default:** 1
- `metadata` <small>optional</small>
String (up to 10KB) that will be stored with the test result and echoed back as "metadata" in the page data of the API results (JSON, HAR and XML). If the string is encoded JSON, then the decoded JSON data will be used instead of the raw string.

### Specifying connectivity
If the connectivity is not specified, by default you will get the Cable (5/1 Mbps, 28ms RTT) profile. The connectivity is specified using the `location` parameter in the format:

`location:browser.connectivity` or `location.connectivity` 

For example:

* ec2-us-east-1:Firefox.DSL
* ec2-us-east-1.DSL
* ec2-eu-central-1.Dial
* ec2-eu-west-3:Chrome%20Canary.4G
* tencent-beijing.custom

Public instances of WebPageTest provide a number of out-of-the box connection profiles for you to use to run tests:

* **DSL** - 1.5 Mbps down, 384 Kbps up, 50 ms first-hop RTT, 0% packet loss
* **Cable** - 5 Mbps down, 1 Mbps up, 28ms first-hop RTT, 0% packet loss
* **FIOS** - 20 Mbps down, 5 Mbps up, 4 ms first-hop RTT, 0% packet loss
* **Dial** - 49 Kbps down, 30 Kbps up, 120 ms first-hop RTT, 0% packet loss
* **Edge** - 240 Kbps down, 200 Kbps up, 840 ms first-hop RTT, 0% packet loss
* **2G** = 280 Kbps down, 256 Kbps up, 800 ms first-hop RTT, 0% packet loss
* **3GSlow** - 400 Kbps down and up, 400 ms first-hop RTT, 0% packet loss
* **3G** - 1.6 Mbps down, 768 Kbps up, 300 ms first-hop RTT, 0% packet loss
* **3GFast** - 1.6 Mbps down, 768 Kbps up, 150 ms first-hop RTT, 0% packet loss
* **4G** - 9 Mbps down and up, 170 ms first-hop RTT, 0% packet loss
* **LTE** - 12 Mbps down and up, 70 ms first-hop RTT, 0% packet loss
* **Native** - No synthetic traffic shaping applied
* **custom** - Custom profile, bandwidth and latency must also be specified using the `bwUp`, `bwDown`, `latency` and `plr` parameters

Browser is only required in a Chrome/Firefox install where wptdriver is configured for multiple browsers.

### Available locations for API calls

On the public instance with an API key that starts with "A.", only locations listed [here](https://www.webpagetest.org/getLocations.php?k=A&f=html) are available for API calls. Others will return `invalid location` when requested.

### Examples
Test www.aol.com and redirect to the results page:

```text
http://www.webpagetest.org/runtest.php?url=www.aol.com
```

Test www.aol.com 10 times, first view only and redirect to the results page:
```text
http://www.webpagetest.org/runtest.php?url=www.aol.com&runs=10&fvonly=1
```
Test www.aol.com 2 times and get the response as xml with the request ID "12345" embedded in the response:
```text
http://www.webpagetest.org/runtest.php?url=www.aol.com&runs=2&f=xml&r=12345
```

## Check test status
You can check the status of a test by doing a GET to http://www.webpagetest.org/testStatus.php with your test id and an optional format parameter. You will get a HTTP 200 response to the request itself indicating that the request was parsed, as well as a return object with details about the test run itself. Alternatively, you can check the status of a test by doing a GET to a [results endpoint](#retrieving-test-results).

### Response Format
By default, the `/testStatus.php` endpoint returns a JSON object. Alternatively, you can request the response object be returned as XML by passing the format (`f`) parameter.

```text
//this will return a JSON response
https://www.webpagetest.org/testStatus.php?test={your_test_id}

//this will return an XML response
https://www.webpagetest.org/testStatus.php?test={your_test_id}&f=xml
```

### Full List of Parameters
::: api-list
- `test` <small>required</small>  
The test ID for the test you want to check the status of.
- `f` <small>optional</small>
The format to return. Set to "xml" to request an XML response; set to "json" to request a JSON-encoded response. If no format parameter is passed, the API call will result in a redirect.
- `callback` <small>optional</small>
Callback function name. When used with `f=json`, the API will return an JSONP response by wrapping the JSON object with the provided callback name.
:::
## Retrieving test results
To retrieve the results of a test run, you can use either the https://www.webpagetest.org/xmlResult.php (to return an XML response) or https://www.webpagetest.org/jsonResult.php (to return a JSON response) endpoint. The endpoint will return a response containing some information about the test itself, as well as an object containing all the metrics recorded across each test run.

As noted in [Status Codes](#status-codes), response codes in the 1xx range indicate that the requested test is not yet ready. Codes in the 4xx range indicate there was an error with the requested test. A status code of 200 indicates a successful test run.

### Response Format
The results endpoints will return a different response type depending on the endpoint you use.

```text
//this will result in an XML response
https://www.webpagetest.org/xmlResult.php

//this will return a JSON response
https://www.webpagetest.org/jsonResult.php
```

Here's an example response, truncated for brevity:

:::caution
There are a **lot** of [metrics](/metrics) recorded by WebPageTest and exposed via the API. We're working on documenting them all. In the meantime, feel free to poke at some sample results (in either [JSON](https://www.webpagetest.org/jsonResult.php?test=210328_XiS8_aeebf094c7b9e3c9c681ec509cdaa911) or [XML](https://www.webpagetest.org/xmlResult.php?test=210328_XiS8_aeebf094c7b9e3c9c681ec509cdaa911) format) to see what's available.

## Cancelling Tests
To cancel a test that has not started running, you can use the http://www.webpagetest.org/cancelTest.php endpoint.

```text
http://www.webpagetest.org/cancelTest.php?test=210328_XiMJ_3c426d8c00c689f22f4097cbb1dfd697&k=81c119174fe742f7a2d778d0a505d096\
```

### Full List of Parameters
::: api-list

:::
## Retrieving Available Locations
You can request a list of available WebPageTest agents as well as the number of pending tests for each using the https://www.webpagetest.org/getLocations.php endpoint.

### Response Format
By default, a successful request to the /getLocations.php endpoint, results an XML response. You can optionally set the response format using the `f` parameter to request a JSON response (`f=json`).

If you pass the `callback` parameter in conjunction with using `f=json`, the endpoint will return a [JSONP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) response with the JSON wrapped in the given callback function name.

```text
//this will result in an XML response
https://www.webpagetest.org/getLocations.php

//this will return a JSON response
https://www.webpagetest.org/getLocations.php?f=json

//this will return a JSONP response, with the JSON wrapped in myCallback()
https://www.webpagetest.org/getLocations.php?f=json&callback=myCallback
```

### Full list of parameters
::: api-list
- `f` <small>optional</small>
The format to return. Set to "xml" to request an XML response; set to "json" to request a JSON-encoded response. If no format parameter is passed, the API call will default to an XML reponse.
- `callback` <small>optional</small>
Callback function name. When used with `f=json`, the API will return an JSONP response by wrapping the JSON object with the provided callback name.
- `r` (string)
Request ID. Will echo back in the response object.
:::

## Checking Remaining Test Balance
To check how how many API tests you have remaining in your current billing period, you can use the https://webpagetest.org/testBalance.php endpoint.


### Response Format
By default, a sucessful request to the /testBalance.php endpoint will result in an JSON response. You can optionally set the response format using the `f` parameter to request an XML response (`f=xml`).

```text
//this will result in a JSON response
https://webpagetest.org/testBalance.php?k={your_api_key}

//this will result in an XML response
https://webpagetest.org/testBalance.php?k={your_api_key}&f=xml
```

Here's an example response:

:::code-tabs
```json
{
    "data": {
        "remaining": 1175
    }
}
```

```xml
<response>
   <data>
      <remaining>1175</remaining>
   </data>
</response>
```
:::

If your API key is invalid, or expired, you will instead see an `error` property with an appropriate message.

```json
{
    "data": {
        "remaining": "Error validating API Key Account"
    }
}
```

```xml
<response>
   <data>
      <remaining>Error validating API Key Account</remaining>
   </data>
</response>
```
### Full List of Parameters
